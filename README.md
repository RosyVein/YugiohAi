# Yugioh Ai

This is a Yugioh Ai Simulator.
The final build will have Ai find the best deck as well as play optimally.

## Breakdown

There are 2 Ais that need to made. A deck building Ai which is written in python. And a game Ai written in c#.

### Setup

* Use Project Ignis Edopro OR if building EdoPro, see https://github.com/edo9300/edopro/wiki/
* You will also need to edit the EDOPro's code in order to launch LAN mode and start the game automaticly when running
  from the python scripts. See ChangestoEdopro.txt
* Download [sqllite expert personal](http://www.sqliteexpert.com/download.html) to read the .cdb database files

### How to run

* Run python train_ai.py -t -r to train the ai. -t is to set the flag to train, -r is to set the flag to reset the
  database
* ```read_game_data.py``` will train all the data in the database. Add the flag -s to see what it thinks which action to
  take
* ```get_action_weights.py``` will run an http server which windbot uses. You must run this if you are going to manualy
  run the AI.
* After building the Windbot, in the Debug/bin file, you can run a pre program AI using this
  command ``` .\WindBot.exe Deck=Master Hand=2 Name=Random2 TotalGames=25 IsTraining=false IsFirst=false ``` and run a
  trained AI using this
  command ``` .\WindBot.exe Deck=Random1 Hand=1 Name=Random1 TotalGames=100 IsFirst=true IsTraining=false IsManual=false ```
  be sure to run the python server by using the command ```get_action_weights.py```.

### Editing the ai

* Notable files in Windbot are Logger.cs, GameAI.cs and RandomExecutorBase.cs
* Logger.cs controls the Weights when they are updated and read
* GameAI controls how the ai works
* RandomExecutorBase controls all the math and decision the AI makes.
* In order to run the AI on EDOPro, you need to update the version number of the windbot in WindbotInfo.cs. You can get
  the version number from EDOPro by running a LAN game, adding a bot, and copying it's launch arguments
